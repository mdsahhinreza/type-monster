                    <p class="text-light text-justify text-lead"><b>Local Storage:</b><br> This read-only interface
                        property provides access to the Document’s local storage object, the stored data is stored
                        across browser sessions. Similar to sessionStorage, except that localStorage data gets cleared
                        when the page session ends – that is when the page is closed. It is cleared when the last
                        “private” tab of a browser is closed (localStorage data for a document loaded in a private
                        browsing or incognito session).<br>

                        DOMStrings are storage formats that use UTF-16 to encode data, which uses two bytes per
                        character. Strings are automatically generated from integer keys just as they are for objects.
                        The data stored in LocalStorage is specific to a protocol in the document. If the site is loaded
                        over HTTP (e.g., http://example.com), localStorage returns a different object than if it is
                        loaded over HTTPS (e.g., https://abc.com).<br><br>

                        If a document is loaded from a file: URL (that is, directly from the user’s local file system
                        instead of being loaded from the server) the requirements for behavior are undefined and may
                        vary among different browsers. Each file appears to be returned a different object by
                        localStorage in all current browsers: URL. Essentially, it seems to be a case of each URL: file
                        having its own unique local storage area.<br>

                        This behavior cannot be guaranteed because as mentioned above, the file: URL requirements remain
                        unclear. As such, there’s a possibility that browsers may change how they handle files at any
                        time. The way some browsers handle it has evolved.</p>
                    <p class="text-light text-justify text-lead"><b>Session Storage:</b><br>
                        Session Storage objects can be accessed using the sessionStorage read-only property. The
                        difference between sessionStorage and localStorage is that localStorage data does not expire,
                        whereas sessionStorage data is cleared when the page session ends.<br><br>

                        A unique page session gets created once a document is loaded in a browser tab. Page sessions are
                        valid for only one tab at a time. Pages are only saved for the amount of time that the tab or
                        the browser is open; they do not persist after the page reloads and restores. A new session is
                        created each time a tab or window is opened; this is different from session cookies. Each
                        tab/window that is opened with the same URL creates its own sessionStorage.When you duplicate a
                        tab, the sessionStorage from the original tab is copied to the duplicated tab. Closing a
                        window/tab ends the session and clears sessionStorage objects.<br><br>

                        A page’s protocol determines what data is stored in sessionStorage. Particularly, data stored by
                        scripts accessed through HTTP (for example, http://abc.com) is stored in a separate object from
                        the same site accessed through HTTPS (for instance, https://abc.com). A DOMString number is two
                        bytes per character in UTF-16 DOMString format. Strings are automatically generated from integer
                        keys just as they are for objects.</p>

                    <p class="text-light text-justify text-lead"><b>The Global scope:</b><br>A variable exists inside or
                        outside a block. If a variable is declared outside all functions or curly braces ({}), it exists
                        in the global scope. The global variables can be accessed by any line of code in the program,
                        including inside blocks.</p>
                    <p class="text-light text-justify text-lead"><b>The Block scope:</b><br>
                        So far, we’ve seen variables defined with the var keyword. Var can declare a variable either in
                        the global or local scope. The variables that are declared within the block scope are comparable
                        to local ones. They are available within the block that they are defined.

                        The main difference between the local scope and block scope is that the block statements (e.g.
                        if conditions or for loops), don't create a new scope. So the var keyword will not have an
                        effect, because the variables are still in the same scope.</p>

                    <p class="text-light text-justify text-lead"><b>Event Loop:</b><br>The Event Loop has one simple job
                        — to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop
                        will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively
                        runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.</p>

                    <p class="text-light text-justify text-lead"><b>What is undefined?:</b><br>The undefined is a
                        primitive type in JavaScript. So the undefined is a type. And the undefined type has exactly one
                        value that is undefined.JavaScript uses the undefined value in the following situations.<br>
                        <br>
                        <b>1. Accessing an uninitialized variable</b><br>
                        When you declare a variable and don’t initialize it to a value, the variable will have a value
                        of undefined.<br><br>
                        <b>2. Accessing a non-existing property of an object</b><br>
                        If you access a non-existing property of an object, you’ll get undefined.<br>
                        <br>
                        <b>3. Function parameters</b><br>When you call a function with a number of parameters, you often
                        pass the same number of arguments.<br><br>
                        <b>4. Functions return a value</b><br>A function that doesn’t have a return statement implicitly
                        returns undefined.<br> <br>
                        <b>5. Accessing out-of-bounds array elements</b><br>When you access an array element that is
                        out-of-bounds, you’ll get the undefined value.<br>
